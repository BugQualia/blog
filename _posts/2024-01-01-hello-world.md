title: Hello, world

A short hello from a minimal Markdown blog. This is the first post, meant to prove the
structure works and provide a little more substance for the outline panel.

- Markdown is the content.
- Jekyll handles the site build.
- GitHub Pages hosts it.

## A slightly longer note

Sometimes a first post is just a placeholder, but it can still be useful. A few extra
paragraphs give the layout more to render and make the outline sidebar feel real.

### What this blog is for

This space is for brief, plain-text writing. The format is intentionally simple: headers,
lists, and short paragraphs that read well in a minimal theme.

### What comes next

- Add a new post when a thought is ready.
- Keep the writing concise.
- Let the structure stay out of the way.
